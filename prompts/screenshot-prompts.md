## Light Thumbnail Prompt

Create a 5:4 cover image (500x400) for a Markdown editor theme called "Bit Clean" in LIGHT mode. Visual direction: clean editorial workspace, Catppuccin Latte color mood (soft off-white, muted blue accents, gentle teal highlights), subtle frosted-glass panels, layered translucent cards, quiet depth, refined typography atmosphere, minimal but warm, high readability feel. No UI logos, no text, no watermarks, no characters. Composition should feel modern, calm, and premium, with balanced negative space for a thumbnail.

## Dark Thumbnail Prompt

Create a 5:4 cover image (500x400) for a Markdown editor theme called "Bit Clean" in DARK mode. Visual direction: focused night workspace, Catppuccin Mocha mood (deep navy-plum background, pastel blue and mint accents), subtle glassmorphism surfaces, soft glow edges, restrained contrast, elegant and distraction-free writing ambiance. No UI logos, no text, no watermarks, no characters. Composition should feel modern, calm, and premium, with balanced negative space for a thumbnail.
